The Bash command-line completion system is very flexible and customizable, and is often packaged with functions that complete arguments and filenames for specific programs and tasks.\\\\n\\\\nBash\\'s syntax has many extensions lacking in the Bourne shell. Bash can perform integer calculations (\\\\\"arithmetic evaluation\\\\\") without spawning external processes. It uses the <code>((\\\\u2026))</code> command and the <code>$((\\\\u2026))</code> variable syntax for this purpose. Its syntax simplifies . For example, it can redirect put (stdout) and  (stderr) at the same time using the <code>&></code> operator. This is simpler to type than the Bourne shell equivalent \\'<code>command > file 2>&1</code>\\'. Bash supports  using the <code><(command)</code> and <code>>(command)</code>syntax, which substitutes the output of (or input to) a command where a filename is normally used. (This is implemented through \\'\\'/proc/fd/\\'\\' unnamed pipes on systems that support that, or via temporary s where necessary).\\\\n\\\\nWhen using the \\'function\\' keyword, Bash function declarations are not compatible with Bourne/Korn/POSIX scripts (the KornShell has the same problem when using \\'function\\'), but Bash accepts the same function declaration syntax as the Bourne and Korn shells, and is POSIX-conformant. Because of these and other differences, Bash shell scripts are rarely runnable under the Bourne or Korn shell interpreters unless deliberately written with that compatibility in mind, which is becoming less common as Linux becomes more widespread. But in POSIX mode, Bash conforms with POSIX more closely.<ref name=\\\\\"GNUBASHREF\\\\\">\\\\n{{Citation\\\\n  | title = The GNU Bash Reference Manual, for Bash, Version 4.1\\\\n  | date = December 23, 2009\\\\n  | chapter = 6.11 Bash POSIX Mode\\\\n  | chapter-url = https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-POSIX-Mode.html\\\\n  | access-date = October 26, 2010\\\\n  | url = https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/index.html\\\\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101203065400/https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/index.html| archive-date= December 3, 2010 | url-status= live}}\\\\n</ref>\\\\n\\\\nBash supports s.

It generates a set of alternative combinations. Generated results need not exist as files. The results of each expanded string are not sorted and left to right order is preserved:\\\\n\\\\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\\\\\"console\\\\\">\\\\n$ echo a{p,c,d,b}e\\\\nape ace ade abe\\\\n$ echo {a,b,c}{d,e,f}\\\\nad ae af bd be bf cd ce cf\\\\n</syntaxhighlight>\\\\nUsers should not use brace expansions in portable shell scripts, because the  does not produce the same output.\\\\n\\\\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\\\\\"console\\\\\">\\\\n$ # A traditional shell does not produce the same output\\\\n$ /bin/sh -c \\'echo a{p,c,d,b}e\\'\\\\na{p,c,d,b}e\\\\n</syntaxhighlight>\\\\n\\\\nWhen brace expansion is combined with wildcards, the braces are expanded first, and then the resulting wildcards are substituted normally. Hence, a listing of JPEG and PNG images in the current directory could be obtained using:\\\\n\\\\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\\\\\"bash\\\\\">\\\\nls *.{jpg,jpeg,png}    # expands to *.jpg *.jpeg *.png - after which,\\\\n                       # the wildcards are processed\\\\necho *.{png,jp{e,}g}   # echo just show the expansions -\\\\n                       # and braces in braces are possible.\\\\n</syntaxhighlight>\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to alternation, brace expansion can be used for sequential ranges between two integers or characters separated by double dots. Newer versions of Bash allow a third integer to specify the increment.  \\\\n\\\\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\\\\\"console\\\\\">\\\\n$ echo {1..10}\\\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\\\\n$ echo {01..10}\\\\n01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10\\\\n$ echo file{1..4}.txt\\\\nfile1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt\\\\n$ echo {a..e}\\\\na b c d e\\\\n$ echo {1..10..3}\\\\n1 4 7 10\\\\n$ echo {a..j..3}\\\\na d g j\\\\n</syntaxhighlight>\\\\n\\\\nWhen brace expansion is combined with variable expansion (A.K.A. \\'\\'parameter expansion\\'\\' and \\'\\'parameter substitution\\'\\') the variable expansion is performed \\'\\'after\\'\\' the brace expansion, which in some cases may necessitate the use of the <code>eval</code> built-in, thus:\\\\n\\\\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\\\\\"console\\\\\">\\\\n$ start=1; end=10\\\\n$ echo {$start..$end}  # fails to expand due to the evaluation order\\\\n{1..10}\\\\n$ eval echo {$start..$end} # variable expansion occurs then resulting string is evaluated\\\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\\\\n</syntaxhighlight>\\\\n\\\\n===Startup scripts===\\\\n\\\\n{{Section howto|date=January 2019}}\\\\n\\\\nWhen Bash starts, it executes the commands in a variety of .

Bash calls these as part of its standard initialization, but other startup files can read them in a different order than the documented Bash startup sequence. The default content of the root user\\'s files may also have issues, as well as the skeleton files the system provides to new user accounts upon setup. The startup scripts that launch the  may also do surprising things with the user\\'s Bash startup scripts in an attempt to set up user-environment variables before launching the .

The <code>fg</code> command brings a process to the foreground, while <code>bg</code> sets a stopped process running in the background. <code>bg</code> and <code>fg</code> can take a job id as their first argument, to specify the process to act on.
